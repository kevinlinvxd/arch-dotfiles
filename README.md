## Introduction

This repository serves as a way for me to keep track of and maintain my configuration files on Linux. If I ever want to switch to a new distro or lose my data, I have an easy way to get to a semi-working state.

## Contents

- all `vim` configuration files, including various plugins and my `.vimrc`
- all my shell configuration in `.zshrc`
- all my configurations for my Arch BSPWM install
  - including `polybar`, `dunst`, and `rofi`
  
## Scripts

At some point, I may write up a simple script to assist with installing these various configuration files to a *possible* new system.
